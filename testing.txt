once again mr . costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary . aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences , of which there are very few i just did not care about any of the characters . most of us have ghosts in the closet , and costner's character are realized early on , and then forgotten until much later , by which time i did not care . the character we should really care about is a very cocky , overconfident ashton kutcher . the problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet . his only obstacle appears to be winning over costner . finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker , costner tells us all about kutcher's ghosts . we are told why kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing . no magic here , it was all i could do to keep from turning it off an hour in .
my boyfriend and i went to watch the guardian . at first i didn't want to watch it , but i loved the movie - it was definitely the best movie i have seen in sometime . they portrayed the uscg very well , it really showed me what they do and i think they should really be appreciated more . not only did it teach but it was a really good movie . the movie shows what the really do and how hard the job is . i think being a uscg would be challenging and very scary . it was a great movie all around . i would suggest this movie for anyone to see . the ending broke my heart but i know why he did it . the storyline was great i give it 2 thumbs up . i cried it was very emotional , i would give it a 20 if i could !
